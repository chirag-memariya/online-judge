# Online Judge System

## Overview
The Online Judge System is a platform for solving coding problems and automating code evaluations. Users can submit solutions to various problems, which are evaluated against predefined test cases in a secure environment. The system provides real-time feedback, including verdicts on submissions and leaderboards for top performers.

## Key Features
- **User Management**: Secure registration and authentication with JWT.
- **Problem Management**: View and solve coding problems with detailed statements and difficulty levels.
- **Code Submission**: Submit code for evaluation; each submission is processed in an isolated Docker container.
- **Result Evaluation**: Automated evaluation of submissions with results stored and displayed.
- **Caching**: Utilizes Redis to cache frequently accessed data.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: Integrates tools to detect similar submissions.
- **Optional Features**: Leaderboard display, user profile management, and code history storage.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for an interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Express.js (Node.js) for handling API requests and code submissions.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, problems, test cases, and submission results.
- **Containerization**: Docker ensures secure and isolated execution environments for code submissions.
- **Message Queuing**: RabbitMQ (or similar) manages high volumes of code submissions efficiently.

## Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment and consistency across environments.
- **CI/CD** (Optional): Automate testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- **Cloud Hosting** (Optional): Deploy on cloud platforms for scalability.

## Scalability and Security
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes, auto-scaling based on traffic, and MongoDB sharding.
- **Security**: Secure data transmission via HTTPS, rate limiting, and regular updates to Docker images.

## Workflow
1. **Registration/Login**: Users authenticate and receive JWT tokens.
2. **Problem Interaction**: Browse and select problems to solve.
3. **Code Submission**: Submit code, which is processed in Docker containers.
4. **Result Display**: View results and leaderboard updates based on submissions.
